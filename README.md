## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces a static website, EPUB, print-ready version, and (where appropriate) CTS TEI XML for contributing back to OGL / showing in Scaife
* corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners (and producers of graded Greek reading material)
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.

## Texts

see [Texts](/texts).

## Non-Text Data

Some relevant data projects

* <https://github.com/jtauber/core-gnt-vocab>
* <https://github.com/morphgnt/morphological-lexicon>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-vocabulary-list>

plus other stuff I still need to open up consolidating vocabulary lists like DCC and the "Major 80" and also lists of principal parts.

## Tools

Some relevant code projects (plus a few more closed-source still to open up)

* <https://github.com/jtauber/text-validator>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-normalisation>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-inflexion>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/vocabulary-tools>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-lemma-mappings>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-reader>

Although note that the point of the `greek-texts` project is mostly producing texts and data. The tools are mostly a side-effect.
