## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces a static website, EPUB, print-ready version, and (where appropriate) CTS TEI XML for contributing back to OGL / showing in Scaife
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.
