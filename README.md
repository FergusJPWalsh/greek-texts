# greek-texts

organising collaboration on Greek texts for learners

## Who We Are

* James Tauber — <https://jktauber.com>
* Seumas Macdonald — <https://thepatrologist.com>
* David Maddock — <http://davemaddock.com>
* Fletcher Hardison — <http://www.amindforlanguage.com>
* Ken M. Penner — <http://pseudepigrapha.org>
* Nathan D. Smith — <http://nathan.smithfam.info/>
* more I'll include once I have their permission to name :-)

## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces a static website, EPUB, print-ready version, and (where appropriate) CTS TEI XML for contributing back to OGL / showing in Scaife
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.

## Texts

#### Ancient Texts

* GNT (in discussion about which version but in some part building on <https://github.com/morphgnt>)
* LXX (<https://github.com/sleeptillseven/LXX-Swete> and <https://github.com/nathans/lxx-swete>)
* Apostolic Fathers — <https://jtauber.github.io/apostolic-fathers/>
* Epictetus's Enchiridion — <https://github.com/jtauber/enchiridion>
* ???

#### 18th–20th Century Greek Readers

* <https://github.com/seumasjeltzz/EasyGreekReaders>

#### Born-Digital Readers

* LGPSI — <https://github.com/seumasjeltzz/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata>

## Non-Text Data

Some of my relevant projects

* <https://github.com/jtauber/core-gnt-vocab>
* <https://github.com/morphgnt/morphological-lexicon>

plus other stuff I still need to open up consolidating vocabulary lists like DCC and the "Major 80" and also lists of principal parts.

## Tools

Some of my relevant projects (a few more closed-source to open up)

* <https://github.com/jtauber/text-validator>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-normalisation>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-inflexion>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/vocabulary-tools>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-lemma-mappings>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-reader>

Although note that the point of this project is producing texts (and annotations). The tools are mostly a side-effect.
