Some relevant code projects (plus a few more closed-source still to open up)

* <https://github.com/jtauber/text-validator>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-normalisation>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-inflexion>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/vocabulary-tools>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-lemma-mappings>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-reader>

Although note that the point of the `greek-texts` project is mostly producing texts and data. The tools are mostly a side-effect.
