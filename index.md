title: Greek Texts
---

organising collaboration on Greek texts and vocabulary lists for learners

## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed base texts following agreed-upon conventions
* tooling which produces a static website, EPUB, print-ready version, and (where appropriate) CTS TEI XML for contributing back to OGL / showing in Scaife
* corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners (and producers of graded Greek reading material)
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.
