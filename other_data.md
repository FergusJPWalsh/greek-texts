Some relevant data projects

* <https://github.com/jtauber/core-gnt-vocab>
* <https://github.com/morphgnt/morphological-lexicon>
* <https://github.com/jtauber/greek-vocabulary-list>

plus other stuff I (James) still need to open up consolidating vocabulary lists like DCC and the "Major 80" and also lists of principal parts.
